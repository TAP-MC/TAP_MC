# # Help:
# #   "GUI_Size" is the size of the GUI. The number must be between inclusive 9 and inclusive 54 and must be divisible by 9.
# #
# #   "Dominate_In_Commands" means the priority for one command.
# #
# #   For example: A player runs the "/warp"-command and your
# #   server has Essentials activated and this System.
# #   The server refer the command to the plugin, which was activated
# #   first.
# #   If you toggle the command "Warp" in this section to true, it
# #   will be run in every case and will blocks all other system in
# #   that moment.
# #
# #
# #
# #   Commands.Warp.GUI: Turn this to false, if you want to use this command for teleports ("/warp spawn"). If you turn this to 'true', the gui opens by running this command
